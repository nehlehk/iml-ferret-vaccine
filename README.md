(Kargarfard et al., 2025, submitted to Briefings in Bioinformatics)

📘 **Overview**

This study applies interpretable machine learning (IML) to multi-omics data from a controlled ferret vaccination experiment.
Using the TreeFARMS framework coupled with Rashomon set exploration, the workflow identifies compact, rule-based models that distinguish vaccinated from unvaccinated animals and reveal stable molecular signatures of vaccine response.

Unlike traditional black-box ensemble models, this approach provides transparent, biologically meaningful rules that can be directly examined and validated by researchers.

⚙️ **Workflow Summary**

The analysis proceeds in five main stages:

**Data preprocessing**

  Import, QC filtering, imputation, normalization, and scaling of multi-omics features
  
  Feature discretization using TreeFARMS threshold-guessing algorithm

**Cross-validation setup**

5-fold stratified CV by individual ferret to prevent data leakage

**Model training (TreeFARMS)**

Global optimization via GOSDT solver (λ = 0.008)

Generation of sparse, interpretable if–then rule sets

**Rashomon set exploration**

Extraction of all near-optimal trees within 5 % of global optimum

Quantification of rule and feature recurrence across models

**Interpretability & visualization**

Aggregation of stable features and visualization of model diversity

Comparison with Random Forest baseline
